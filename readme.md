# Project Name

This project helps you process video and YAML files with Python. It uses the `moviepy.editor` library for video editing, and configuration is managed through the `py_config.py` file.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed.

### Installing Dependencies

1. Clone this repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages. Run the following command to install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install `moviepy` and any other necessary packages.

   If you haven't created a `requirements.txt` file yet, you can generate it by running:

   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install any additional software or libraries needed for video editing, depending on the operating system you're using. For `moviepy`, you might need to install `ffmpeg`. You can download it from [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add it to your system's PATH.

### MoviePy Setup

1. **Install MoviePy**

   If you didn't add `moviepy` to `requirements.txt`, you can manually install it by running:

   ```bash
   pip install moviepy
   ```

2. **FFmpeg Installation**

   MoviePy relies on FFmpeg to handle video processing. Follow these steps to install FFmpeg:

   - **Windows**: Download FFmpeg from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). Unzip the folder and add the `bin` directory to your system's PATH.
   - **macOS/Linux**: You can install FFmpeg via a package manager:
     - For macOS, use Homebrew: `brew install ffmpeg`
     - For Ubuntu/Debian, run: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`

### Configuring `py_config.py`

The `py_config.py` file contains configuration settings for the project. 

1. Open the `py_config.py` file in a text editor.
2. Modify the configuration values as needed for your setup. Hereâ€™s an example of what the file might look like:

   ```python
   # py_config.py

   # Path to the video directory
   VIDEO_DIR = '/path/to/your/videos/'

   # Output directory for processed videos
   OUTPUT_DIR = '/path/to/output/'

   # Logging level for debugging
   LOG_LEVEL = 'INFO'
   ```

   Update the paths to point to the correct directories on your machine where your videos are stored, and where you want to save the processed output.

3. If you are working with different formats or need other custom configurations, feel free to add additional variables in the `py_config.py` file.

### Using the Project

1. **Edit Videos**: After configuring your paths, you can start working with the videos using the provided functions. If you're using `moviepy`, you can do something like this:

   ```python
   from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip
   from py_config import VIDEO_DIR, OUTPUT_DIR

   # Load video
   video = VideoFileClip(f"{VIDEO_DIR}/example.mp4")

   # Apply edits (e.g., trimming, resizing)
   edited_video = video.subclip(0, 10)  # First 10 seconds

   # Save the edited video
   edited_video.write_videofile(f"{OUTPUT_DIR}/edited_example.mp4")
   ```

2. **Running the Script**: To run the script, simply execute it from the terminal:

   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

3. **File Exclusions**: This repository includes a `.gitignore` file that ensures that large files like `.mp4` and `.yaml` files are excluded from version control. The following file types will be ignored:

   - `.mp4`
   - `.yaml`
   - `.yml`

   This helps keep your Git repository clean and ensures that only relevant files are tracked.
